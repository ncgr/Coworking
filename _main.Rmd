# ABOUT US{-}

NM-INBRE (New Mexico IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence):
NM-INBRE Champions biomedical and community based research excellence in the state of New Mexico through the development of innovative, supportive and sustainable research environments for faculty and students, community engaging health initiatives, while building a network of lead scientists and educators at the state, regional and national level.
 
Funded by the Institutional Development Award (IDeA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) & National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)  Grant # P20GM103451 
NCGR (National Center for Genome Research): 

Located in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the National Center for Genome Resources is a not-for-profit research institute that innovates, collaborates, and educates in the field of genomic data science. As leaders in DNA sequence analysis, we partner with government, industry, and academia to drive biological discovery in all kingdoms of life. 
NCGR operates NM-INBRE's Sequencing and Bioinformatics Core (SBC).  Through this partnership we offer the NM-INBRE SBC Pilot Award, which is a funding opportunity primarily for New Mexico researchers through which NCGR can help you with your research. 

## SBC PILOT AWARD RFP{-}
The New Mexico IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (NM-INBRE) Sequencing and Bioinformatics Core (SBC) invites you to apply for a pilot project award to drive your research, publications and grants!

Award amount varies depending on various factors including your organization's affiliation with INBRE, RAIN or NM-INBRE.  Award may require a co-contribution. Please reach out to inbre@ncgr.org for more information or complete an application!

## How to Apply:{-} 

Submit proposal via this webform: NM-INBRE SBC Pilot Award Application​​

NOTES:
Proposals from ‘non’ NM-INBRE investigators will require a co-contribution to foster state, regional and national INBRE collaborations.  Funds spent towards sequencing through NCGR or our partner can count towards this co-contribution.  
Past winners may apply, but new applicants have priority if all other factors are equal.

On any material presented or published based on this work, acknowledgement of:
Funding provided by the NM-INBRE Sequencing and Bioinformatics Core (SBC) at NCGR through NIGMS IDeA-Award P20GM103451.

# Pangenomics Workshop{-}

Application: Fill out this online application here: Pangenomics Workshop Application

Space is limited!


## When{-}

February 12-16, 2024


## Where{-}

Online (by the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR) Santa Fe, NM)


## Audience{-}

This program is geared towards training biologists (undergraduates, graduates and researchers) with minimal or no bioinformatics experience. Space is limited.


## Topic Overview{-}

The proliferation of reference quality genome assemblies within any single species has necessitated the need for pangenome analyses. Such analyses remove reference-bias and elucidate biological signals at a more comprehensive population scale. In this workshop, students will learn what exactly a pangenome is, how to build a pangenome, and how to perform fundamental bioinformatic analyses on pangenomic data.


## Objective{-}

Students will learn to use the command-line interface to conduct graphical pangenome analyses. Specifically, students will learn to build pangenome graphs using vg, minigraph, and Cactus. They will learn to visualize these pangenomes using Bandage and IGV, and they will learn how to map reads and call variants on the graphs, comparing both run-time and mapping performance between methods. Additionally, students will be given an overview of other, interoperable tools to broaden their understanding of the rapidly moving pangenomics space.


## Workshop Rates{-}
